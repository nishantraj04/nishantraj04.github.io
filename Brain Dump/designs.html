            "Designing for a college club is 10% creativity and 90% making sure the logo is centered before the WhatsApp group starts blowing up."
        </p>

        <p>
            When I took on the role of Graphic Designer for the <strong>SOA English Café</strong>, I thought it would be like Dribbble. I thought I’d have weeks to mood board, iterate, and refine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was wrong. Designing for a club is guerrilla warfare. The deadlines are "yesterday," the feedback is vague, and the stakes are surprisingly high because if the poster sucks, nobody shows up. It taught me more about design in 6 months than any online course ever did.
        </p>

        <h3>The "Client" (A.K.A. The Club President)</h3>
        <p>
            In the corporate world, you have stakeholders. In college, you have a 3rd-year student running on caffeine who sends you a message at 11:45 PM:
        </p>
        <div class="client-quote">
            "Bro, can we make the event title 'POP' more? Also, add these 5 logos, the date, the venue, a QR code, and a quote from Shakespeare. Keep it minimalist though."
        </div>
        <p>
            Learning to navigate these requests is a skill they don't teach in class. You learn to negotiate space. You learn to say, <em>"If I make the logo bigger, we have to delete Shakespeare."</em> It’s diplomacy through pixels. You realize that design isn't just about making things look good; it's about solving the problem of "How do I fit a novel's worth of text onto an Instagram square?"
        </p>

        <h3>The "Canva vs. Photoshop" Civil War</h3>
        <p>
            This is the eternal struggle. The PR team wants everything on Canva so they can edit the text later. I want to use Photoshop/Illustrator because I need custom masking, kerning control, and blending modes that don't look cheap.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Compromise:</strong> I design the "Hero Assets" (the main event reveal, the big posters) in high-fidelity software. I create the "Templates" (winner announcements, daily updates) in Canva. It was a lesson in scalability—sometimes speed beats perfection.
        </p>

        <h3>Case Study: The Socrates Trial</h3>
        <p>
            This was one of my favorite challenges. The event was a mock trial of Socrates. The vibe needed to be judicial, ancient, and serious—but not boring.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I went too "history textbook," students would scroll past it on Instagram. If I went too "party vibe," it would disrespect the theme.
        </p>
        <p>
            I settled on a "Dark Academia" aesthetic. High contrast, serif fonts (Cinzel is the GOAT) that look like they were carved into stone, and a moody color palette. I used a marble texture overlay to give it grit. The challenge wasn't just making it look good on my laptop; it was making it legible on a cracked 6-inch phone screen. The result? We had a packed room. Good design puts butts in seats.
        </p>

        <h3>The Arch-Nemesis: WhatsApp Compression</h3>
        <p>
            There is no greater pain for a designer than spending 4 hours perfecting a gradient, exporting a crisp 4K PNG, sending it to the group chat, and watching WhatsApp compress it into a blurry, pixelated potato.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned quickly:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bold Typography is King:</strong> Thin fonts die in compression. Bold fonts survive.</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast Matters:</strong> Subtle grey-on-black looks cool on a monitor. It looks like a smudge on a phone.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Safe Zone":</strong> Instagram Stories crop the top and bottom. If you put the venue details at the absolute bottom, the "Send Message" box covers it. I learned this the hard way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Print Nightmare (RGB vs. CMYK)</h3>
        <p>
            "Why do the colors look dull on the flyer?" asked a team member.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was the day I had to explain color spaces to 10 people. We designed in RGB (for screens), but the cheap campus printer only understood a confused version of CMYK. The bright neon red I used turned into a muddy brick color.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lesson learned: Always proof the colors before printing 500 copies. Always.
        </p>

        <h3>Final_Final_v3_REAL.psd</h3>
        <p>
            My "Downloads" folder is a graveyard of file names like <code>poster_v1.png</code>, <code>poster_final.png</code>, <code>poster_final_FINAL.png</code>, and <code>poster_ACTUALLY_DONE.png</code>. It taught me version control before I even knew what Git was.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It's Worth It</h3>
        <p>
            Despite the panic and the late nights, there is a specific feeling you get when you walk across campus and see a printed version of your work on a notice board, or see people reposting your story.
        </p>
        <p>
            It turns abstract skills into something tangible. It taught me that design isn't just about making things pretty; it's about communication. It’s about getting someone to stop scrolling for 3 seconds and say, "Hey, that looks cool. Let's go."
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, we did eventually delete the Shakespeare quote.
